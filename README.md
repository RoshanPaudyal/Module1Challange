## This project is about fintech Domain **Payments/Billing.**

### The fintech is a very broad term and used to descrive all kind of financial technology which has revolutionalised and transformed the financial industries.While the term is new fintech has been around us for decades. The first ATM went live in 1960's which was the first notable form of fintech.
Fintech have changed the expections of market and consumers. If one company is providing services that is a userfriendly, every other companies within that industries is expected to provide same level of user experience. Its sometimes is too costly for small and medium size business to compete. In years gone by from cash era through to the first terminals, choices were limited in terms of of how business chose to accept payments. Now, we have a huge range of options that business can integrate to process payments. You can accept cash, credit and debit cards, contactless payments such as Apple Pay, and even cryptocurrency. Payment options are also no longer limited to being in-store only.

We can take Stripe as an example in this case study. In 2010, Patrick and John Collison, brothers from rural Ireland, began to debug this process. Their company, Stripe Inc., built software that businesses could plug into websites and apps to instantly connect with credit card and banking systems and receive payments. The product was a hit with Silicon Valley startups. Businesses such as Lyft, Facebook, DoorDash, and thousands that aspired to be like them turned Stripe into the financial backbone of their operations. 

It was late 2009 when the Collisons started working on their payment acceptance service, dropping out of school and moving to Buenos Aires to work full-time on their revolutionary idea. Stripe, even though it was called “slash dev slash payments” back then, felt very natural to the Collisons. They wanted to solve their own problems as well as those of their friends.

If they could remove the need for startups to worry about the financial side of business, then these startups could invest more time and energy into their products and services. With a few internet businesses under their own belt, the Collisons were intimately aware of the problems of accepting payments.

By creating Stripe, they were first focussed mainly on solving their own issues. But within a few months, it became apparent that this lake of potential customers was actually an entire ocean. All of eCommerce could benefit from the service that Stripe provided. And so, their vision became even grander. Enter Y Combinator, the start-up accelerator with several successes under their belt. Founder Paul Graham had already made several hundred thousand dollars with his investment in Auctomatic and once the Collisons applied again, this time with their new Stripe concept, he readily funded it in 2010. Launching a beta test, they attracted more interest from Angel investors, including Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal.
