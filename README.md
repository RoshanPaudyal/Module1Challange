## The fintech is a very broad term and used to descrive all kind of financial technology which has revolutionalised and transformed the financial industries.While the term is new fintech has been around us for decades. The first ATM went live in 1960's which was the first notable form of fintech.
Fintech have changed the expections of market and consumers. If one company is providing services that is a userfriendly, every other companies within that industries is expected to provide same level of user experience. Its sometimes is too costly for small and medium size business to compete. In years gone by from cash era through to the first terminals, choices were limited in terms of of how business chose to accept payments. Now, we have a huge range of options that business can integrate to process payments. You can accept cash, credit and debit cards, contactless payments such as Apple Pay, and even cryptocurrency. Payment options are also no longer limited to being in-store only.
We can take Stripe as an example in this case study. In 2010, Patrick and John Collison, brothers from rural Ireland, began to debug this process. Their company, Stripe Inc., built software that businesses could plug into websites and apps to instantly connect with credit card and banking systems and receive payments. The product was a hit with Silicon Valley startups. Businesses such as Lyft, Facebook, DoorDash, and thousands that aspired to be like them turned Stripe into the financial backbone of their operations.

#### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
It was late 2009 when the Collisons started working on their payment acceptance service, dropping out of school and moving to Buenos Aires to work full-time on their revolutionary idea. Stripe, even though it was called “slash dev slash payments” back then, felt very natural to the Collisons. They wanted to solve their own problems as well as those of their friends. In early 2010 they debated why it was so difficult to accept payments on the web. They sought to solve the solve it and started to practically implementing by making the payment platform really simple. They kept building on their concept by showing it to people and friends and nbased on their feedback they started to iterate along the way.

#### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The first funding came from Y combinator Paul graham. In 2011 another another funding came from paypal co-founders elon Musk and Peter Thiel, Irish enterpreneur Liam Casey, and venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and SV Angel. Stripe has so far raised total of $2.3 Billion in funding over 21 rounds. Ethos VC and National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) are the most recent investors among its 51 investors. Stripe has a post-money valuation in the range of $10 Billion+ as of Mar 14, 2021 , according to PrivCo.

## Business Activities
#### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
According to Stripe's CEO Patric Collison, Stripe aims to give developers the tools they need to create the most secure and novel buying experiences. They solved the problem by making it possible to accept payments simply by adding a few lines of code to your website. That doesn't mean that accepting payments online doesn't still involve complicated processes, but to the end user, none of that matters. Stripe does it all. Their partnership with Visa will accelerate their ability to expand to markets around the world, and give developers even more control over the end-to-end experience.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would make a recommendation that stripe could offer subscription based pricing model and direct cost of interchange transaction fees like Stax. This is becasue per transaction fee for some business could be a big overhead and would rather go for a different payment platform like Stax where they can pay one subcription for a month or a year. Lot of businesses can forcast the number of transaction they will be processing in a certain time period based on which they can buy subscription.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
